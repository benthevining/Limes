/** A pitch detector based on the YIN algorithm.

	A pitch detection algorithm based on the influential YIN @cite de_cheveign√©_kawahara_2002 paper, with a few alterations of my own.

	@section algorithm The algorithm

	@subsection difference The difference function

	The core of the algorithm is the difference function, defined as:

	@f[
		d_t(\tau)=\sum\limits_{j=t}^{j<N-\tau} (x_j-x_{j+\tau})^2
	@f]
	@f[
		D(\tau)=\sum\limits_{t=0}^{t<N} d_t(\tau)
	@f]

	where:
	- @f$ d_t(\tau) @f$ is the autocorrelation function at lag @f$ \tau @f$ of input signal @f$ x @f$ at sample @f$ t @f$;
	- @f$ D(\tau) @f$ is the summation of all values @f$ d_t(\tau) @f$ for each sample index @f$ t @f$ in the current frame of audio of length @f$ N @f$.

	This autocorrelation function is calculated for every lag @f$ \tau @f$ within the set of possible period values, and the @f$ \tau @f$ value whose autocorrelation function
	shows the lowest amount of difference between the original and delayed signal (ie, the lowest value of @f$ D(\tau) @f$) is determined to be the period.

	@subsection cmndf The cumulative mean normalized difference function

	To attempt to stabilize results for different integration window sizes across a frame of audio, the YIN paper introduces the concept of a cumulative mean normalized difference function, which is defined as:

	@f[
		d\prime_t(\tau)=\frac{d_t(\tau)}{(1/\tau)\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\tau}d_t(i)}
	@f]

	Essentially, the result of the original difference function is divided by its average over shorter-lag values.
	The final summation step then becomes:

	@f[
		D(\tau)=\sum\limits_{t=0}^{t<N} \frac{d_t(\tau)}{(1/\tau)\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\tau}d_t(i)}
	@f]

	@subsection thresh Absolute threshold

	Once the cumulative mean normalized difference function has been applied, the @f$ D(\tau) @f$ values are suitably normalized, allowing us to apply a simple threshold to the entire set of @f$ D(\tau) @f$
	values for each @f$ \tau @f$ in the range of possible periods.

	This threshold value can be thought of as the amount of aperiodic power tolerable in a signal determined to be pitched.
	In other words, the lower this value is, the "stricter" the pitch detector is in choosing its pitch estimates.
	When this value is 1, the pitch detector might output a "pitch" value for a frame of random noise; when this value is 0, the pitch detector might say that even a perfect, pure sine wave is "unpitched".
	Typical recommended values are between 0.1 and 0.3.

	The YIN paper recommends to implement this threshold such that the smallest value of @f$ D(\tau) @f$ is chosen that gives a minimum of @f$ d\prime_t(\tau) @f$ that is lower than our threshold.
	In other words, we choose the smallest period that satisfies our periodicity threshold.
	The exact value of this threshold does not critically affect error rates, though it can be tuned for specific use cases to provide more optimal results.

	@subsection interp Parabolic interpolation

	Finally, once we've determined an integer estimate of @f$ \tau @f$ that is the best candidate to be the period, parabolic interpolation is used to determine the actual period (which probably is not an even number of samples).

	Interpolation is done by looking at local minima of the set of @f$ D(\tau) @f$ values around our candidate @f$ \tau @f$, and the abscissa of the chosen minimum becomes the actual period estimate.
	To avoid any biasing in this interpolation step, the *raw* difference function data is used -- @f$ d_t(\tau) @f$, not @f$ d\prime_t(\tau) @f$.

	@section Discussion Discussion

	This pitch detection algorithm is performed entirely in the time domain.

	The detector is stateful; it assumes that the input pitch shouldn't halve or double between consecutive pitched frames of audio,
	and uses this heuristic to limit its period search range for each frame of audio.
	Limiting the number of possible period candidates reduces the number of times the difference function needs to be calculated.

	Pitch detector objects can only be used for one channel of audio at a time, because they are stateful.
	If you need to run pitch detection on multiple channels of audio, you need multiple PitchDetector objects.

	@section Latency Latency

	The latency of the algorithm is determined by 2 times the period of the lowest detectable frequency;
	therefore, detectors configured to not try to detect lower pitches will have less latency.
	You can adjust the lowest detectable frequency of the pitch detector to fit your needs.

	This class does not do any internal buffering; the caller must ensure that the buffers sent to the detection functions contain enough samples for the detection algorithm.
