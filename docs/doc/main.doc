	Limes is a collection of C++ libraries providing both low-level utilities and high-level abstractions that I have found useful to have in a centralized location.

	Limes also provides a few small command-line utilities built using these libraries, and some CMake scripts for integrating Limes features into your build.

	Limes consists of the following libraries:

	Name                  | Description                 | Dependencies
	--------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------
	limes_audio           | Realtime audio utilities    | limes_vecops
	limes_core            | Core utilities              | None
	limes_midi            | MIDI utilities              | limes_core
	limes_music           | Music theory utilities      | limes_core
	limes_vecops          | SIMD operations for vectors | limes_core

	And the following command line utilities:

	Name          | Description
	------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
	FileUtil      | OS-agnostic interface for a wide variety of filesystem tasks
	BinaryBuilder | Generates C++ source files which embed binary data files

	The following reference manuals are available:
	- @subpage using_limes Compiling & using Limes
	- @subpage find_limes The FindLimes.cmake script
	- @subpage limes_programs Utility programs

	Here is the dependency graph for Limes:
