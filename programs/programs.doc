	@section prgm_discussion Discussion

	Limes ships several small command-line utility programs, both as part of the testing process of the Limes libraries, but also because these utility programs can be genuinely useful.

	Limes ships the following programs:

	Name          | Description
	------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
	FileUtil      | OS-agnostic interface for a wide variety of filesystem tasks
	BinaryBuilder | Generates C++ source files which embed binary data files

	@section prgm_crosscomp Crosscompiling

	When building the Limes programs in a crosscompiling scenario, they usually need to be executed on the *host* system, not the *target* system.

	Because of this, when crosscompiling, a child CMake is invoked at configure time to execute the build of the programs for the *host* system,
	so that their artefacts are then available to the configuration for the *target* system.

	@subpage binary_builder BinaryBuilder
	@subpage file_util FileUtil

	@installcompgroup \b limes_programs
	@parblock
	Installs all Limes programs.

	This component is analogous to the `find_package()` component \c Programs .
